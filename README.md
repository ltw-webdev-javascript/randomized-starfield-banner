# Randomized starfield banner

## Overview

- *Fork this repository.*
- Write Javascript that will generate 75 stars into the banner with random locations, opacities, rotations, and scales.
- Animate the `width` and `height` of the stars so they pulse.
- *Much of the CSS is written for you: concentrate on the `animation`*
- **DO NOT change the HTML.**
- *Run it through Markbot and make sure it passes all the checks.*

## Details
